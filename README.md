## Real-Time Device Tracking App

A highly scalable real-time device tracking application built with ```Node.js```, ```Express```, ```Socket.io```, ```kafka``` and ```MongoDB```. This application allows users to track the location of devices in real-time using WebSocket communication and Kafka for efficient data handling, making it suitable for applications with high user loads.

## Features

- **Real-Time Location Updates**: Users can view the live location of devices on an interactive map.
- **Highly Scalable Architecture**: Utilizes Kafka to manage high throughput of location updates, ensuring seamless performance even with thousands of concurrent users.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Location data is stored in MongoDB, providing durability and easy retrieval for analysis.
- **Socket.io Integration**: Enables instant communication between the client and server, ensuring low-latency updates.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: ```JavaScript``` and ```Leaflet.js (for maps)```
- **Backend**: ```Node.js```, ```Express```, ```Socket.io```
- **Database**: ```MongoDB```
- **Message Broker**: ```Kafka (with zookeeper)```

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Docker Desktop** - Installed on your machine

## Docker Image

### Pulling the zookeeper image
```bash
docker run -p 2181:2181 zookeepr
```

### Pulling the kafka image
```bash
docker run -p 9092:9092 -e KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=<IP_Address>:9092 -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://<IP_Address>:9092 -e KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1 confluentinc/cp-kafka
```

### Running the Application

1. **Clone the repo** 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TusharRanjan2401/realtime-tracker.git
```

2. Create a ```.env``` file in the root

**Add environment variables**

```bash
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/device_tracker
KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092
```

## Installation

Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the Application

```bash
npm start
```

## Notes

- Ensure that `kafka` and `zookeepr` containers are running in `Docker` on your machine before starting the application.
